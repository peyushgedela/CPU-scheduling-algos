# CPU Scheduling Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms written in C. Each algorithm demonstrates a different strategy used in operating systems.

## Algorithms Included

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: `FCFS.c`
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: `shortestJobFirst.c`
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**: `shortestRemTimeFirst.c`
- **Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)**: `priorityNonPremptive.c`
- **Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)**: `priorityPremptive.c`
- **Round Robin (RR)**: `roundRobin.c`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- C Standard Library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cpu-scheduling-algorithms
   ```

3. Compile the desired algorithm. For example, to compile FCFS:

   ```bash
   gcc FCFS.c -o fcfs
   ```

4. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./fcfs
   ```

## Usage

Each algorithm has its own source file. You can modify input parameters directly in the source code to test different scheduling scenarios.
